  <h3 align="center">About </h3>
<p align="center">
Since from a young age I have been passionate about science,technology and innovation. Even though I was just a fan at that time I have always 
been fascinated about how much more can a computer do. I grew up with a dream of being a scientist and to develop solutions that will change the world and 
this what drives me everyday. I am self driven, goal orientated and so throughout my career life I hve been taking steps closer to my dreams, I taught myself programming and became a freelancing developer and then later went to study a BSc Computer Science & Informatics from the University of Johannesburg and I am currently working as a software developer.
