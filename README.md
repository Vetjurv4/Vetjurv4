  <h3 align="center">About </h3>
<p align="center">
Since from a young age I have been a fan of science,technology and innovation. Even though I was just a fan at that time I have always 
been fascinated about how much more can a computer do ( :joy: yeah I have been interested in making sci-fi a reality). This is the reason I
dreamt of being a scientist ( :smiley: You don't know the excitment now that I am a Computer Scientist :sunglasses: ). Therefore these projects don't reflect my ability
but rather some of what I have learnt so far. Welcome to my learning journey of becoming the best computer scientist.!!!!
