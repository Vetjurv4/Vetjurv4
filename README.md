  <h3 align="center">About </h3>
<p align="center">
Welcome to my GitHub profile! From a young age, I've been passionate about science, technology, and innovation. My fascination with computers sparked a dream of becoming a scientist and creating solutions that can change the world. This drive has shaped my career path: I taught myself programming, became a freelance developer, and earned a BSc in Computer Science & Informatics from the University of Johannesburg.
This platform serves as my creative space, showcasing a variety of projects Iâ€™ve developed for different purposesâ€”some to enhance my skills, others to explore innovative ideas, and many to contribute to the community.
